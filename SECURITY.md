# Security Policy

Phylum was founded by a team of security researchers at heart, and we take the security of our tooling seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We love coordinated disclosure!
Please email [security@phylum.io](mailto:security@phylum.io) to start a conversation!
We'll coordinate a secure communication mechanism first, then evaluate the reported issue(s)
and keep you apprised each step of the way.
